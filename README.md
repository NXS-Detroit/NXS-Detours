# NXS Detours
This repository is a working listing of all NXS detours - past, present, and recurring.

Detours are written at a page per event - that is to say, a single construction event that detours routes 10, 12, and 64 will receive one page listing the detours for all three routes.

When adding a detour, please specify:

* All known roads that are closed
* Type of detour (construction or event)
* Source of information
* Start and end of detour (if known)
