# Station info

## Bagley/First Station
All Fast Lines and routes 100, 105, 109, 200, 203, 300, 305, 400, 405, 500, 505, 800, 814, and 950 serve Bagley Station on the west side of Downtown Detroit.

* Inbound buses drop off at the stop on eastbound Bagley, stop #746.
* Outbound buses pick up at stops along westbound Bagley, all #494.

Due to the number of buses picking up, multiple stops are located on westbound Bagley; route numbers serving each stop are displayed on signs.

The Downtown Express reverses this trend for easier transfers - buses coming from Lafayette Station drop off at the westbound stop, and buses heading to Lafayette Station pick up at the eastbound stop.

Since this isn't a regular station, a Waiting Bus will be available near the westbound stops.

## Lafayette Station
The Pink Line and routes 508, 600, 605, 700, and 800 serve Lafayette Station on the east side of Downtown Detroit.

* Inbound routes 508, 605, and 700 drop off, and the outbound Pink Line and westbound Downtown Express pick up, at the stop on eastbound Lafayette, #1438.
* Outbound routes 508, 605, and 700 drop off, and the inbound Pink Line and eastbound Downtown Express drop off, at the stop on westbound Lafayette, #1687.
